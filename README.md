# Martialis - An Open Framework for Knowledge Graphs-based Retrieval Augmented Generation
## Overview
Martialis is a next-generation framework designed to enhance the performance of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in solving complex linguistic tasks in domain-specific contexts (e.g., healthcare, legal, manufacturing). By integrating **Knowledge Graphs** (KGs) and **Ontologies**, Martialis provides accurate answers and generates structured, domain-specific texts.

## Key Innovations
* _Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration_: combines sub-symbolic (LLMs) and symbolic AI (Knowledge Graphs) for enhanced reasoning.
* _Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)_: augments traditional RAG techniques with domain-specific KGs for precise responses.
* _Ontology-Based Validation_: ensures generated outputs align with predefined ontologies, improving consistency and reliability.
* _Open-Source and Modular_: fully customizable for diverse domains and use cases.

## ARCHITECTURE
The framework is built with a modular architecture, enabling customization and adaptability to various use cases. Each module can be replaced or extended to meet specific requirements.

The core components of Martialis are:

1. **Automatic KG-Extractor**: automatically generates domain-specific KGs from unstructured documents, providing a structured representation of the domain's knowledge.

2. **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)**: enhances the standard RAG pipeline by integrating domain-specific KGs to support reasoning and generate accurate responses to complex queries.

3. **Ontology-Based Validator**: ensures the generated outputs align with predefined ontologies, validating their structure and content to guarantee consistency and compliance.
