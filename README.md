# Martialis
## Overview
Martialis is a next-generation framework designed to enhance the performance of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in solving complex linguistic tasks in domain-specific contexts (e.g., healthcare, legal, manufacturing). By integrating **Knowledge Graphs** (KGs) and **Ontologies**, Martialis provides accurate answers and generates structured, domain-specific texts.

## Key Innovations
* _Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration_: combines sub-symbolic (LLMs) and symbolic AI (Knowledge Graphs) for enhanced reasoning.
* _Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)_: augments traditional RAG techniques with domain-specific KGs for precise responses.
* _Ontology-Based Validation_: ensures generated outputs align with predefined ontologies, improving consistency and reliability.
* _Open-Source and Modular_: fully customizable for diverse domains and use cases.
